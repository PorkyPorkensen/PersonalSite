            <p>My name is Mitchell Vieira, and I was born and raised just outside of the GTA (Greater Toronto Area), in a city of approximately 150,000 residents. I attended Carleton University from 2017 to 2019, 
                where I pursued a degree in Commerce before having to step away due to medical reasons. Since then, I have gained 
                experience in the retail sector and spent three years with Just Junk, a local waste management company. In this 
                role, I worked directly with customers, delivering prompt and courteous service.</p>

                <p>For almost 3 years, I have immersed myself in web development through self-guided learning and structured 
                    online courses. Iâ€™ve completed 100s of hours of coursework, over 1500 lessons, and a multitude of solo projects as 
                    part of Scrimba's "Frontend Career Path". Alongside that, I have also followed along with a multitude of YouTube crash courses revolving around the MERN stack.
                    I am proficient in JavaScript, React, NodeJS, Express, CSS, HTML, Git and am currently delving into the worlds of TypeScript and Python.</p>

                <p>In addition to coding, I am passionate about my dogs, gaming, MMA, basketball, and football.</p>
