            <p>My name is Mitchell Vieira, and I was born and raised in Barrie, Ontario, a city of approximately 150,000 residents. I attended Carleton University from 2017 to 2019, 
                where I pursued a degree in Commerce before having to step away due to medical reasons. Since then, I have gained 
                experience in the retail sector and spent three years with Just Junk, a local waste management company. In this 
                role, I worked directly with customers, delivering prompt and courteous service.</p>

                <p>For the past two years, I have immersed myself in frontend development through self-guided learning and structured 
                    online courses via Scrimba. Iâ€™ve completed over 90 hours of coursework, 1,400 lessons, and a multitude of solo projects as 
                    part of their "Frontend Career Path." I am proficient in JavaScript, React, CSS, HTML, Git and am currently delving
                    into the worlds of TypeScript and Python.</p>

                <p>In addition to coding, I am passionate about gaming, WEB3 technologies, MMA, basketball, and football.</p>
